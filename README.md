## Overview

BERT-AI-Resume is a project that leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to provide intelligent resume analysis and enhancement. It aims to assist job seekers in creating more effective resumes by offering insights into resume quality, suggesting improvements, and ultimately, matching resumes with suitable job opportunities through AI-driven analysis.

This project analyzes resume content to identify key skills, experiences, and qualifications, and it provides actionable suggestions to improve clarity, formatting, and overall content. While under active development, the project strives to incorporate the latest advancements in NLP to deliver a cutting-edge resume enhancement tool.

> **Note:** This project is under active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Features

*   **Resume Analysis:** Analyzes resume content to identify key skills, experiences, and qualifications using BERT-based NLP techniques.
*   **Improvement Suggestions:** Provides suggestions for improving resume clarity, formatting, and content based on industry best practices and BERT's understanding of language nuances.
*   **Skill Extraction:** Automatically extracts skills from the resume text, categorizes them, and highlights missing skills relevant to target job roles.
*   **Job Matching (Future):** A future goal is to match resumes to job descriptions using semantic similarity analysis powered by BERT. This feature will rank job opportunities based on how well a resume aligns with the requirements.
*   **Keyword Optimization:** Identifies and suggests relevant keywords to incorporate into the resume, increasing its visibility to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ## Usage

1.  **Prepare your resume:**

    Ensure your resume is in a text-extractable format (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`). If it's a `.pdf` or `.docx`, the script will attempt to convert it to text.  You might need to install extra dependencies like `pdfminer.six` or `python-docx` if they are not already installed via `requirements.txt`.

2.  **Run the analysis script:**

    Navigate to the `src` directory and run the `resume_analyzer.py` script.

    > **Note:** Replace `../data/your_resume.pdf` with the actual path to your resume file.  You may need to adjust the path depending on your directory structure.  The script may require command-line arguments to specify the resume file path and other options. Refer to the script's help message (`python resume_analyzer.py --help`) for details.

3.  **View the analysis results:**

    The script will output the analysis results to the console.  This will include identified skills, suggested improvements, and other relevant information.  Future versions may include options to save the results to a file.
